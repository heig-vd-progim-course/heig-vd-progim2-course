# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository contains teaching materials for a programming course
(heig-vd-progim2-course).

## Course Configuration

**Customize these values for different courses:**

- **Course Language**: French
- **Programming Language**: Java (version 11+)
- **Student Level**: Beginner - first programming course, no prior experience
- **Target Audience**: Students learning programming for the first time
- **Content Type**: Educational presentations (Marp), code examples, exercises,
  PlantUML diagrams
- **Topics Covered**: Algorithms, data structures, software design fundamentals

## Teaching Philosophy

This course follows key pedagogical principles:

- **Straight to the point**: Quick, efficient and useful content without wasting
  time
- **Open**: Content can be improved, changed, and discussed openly
- **Resilient**: Materials should be understandable and maintainable by others
- **Freedom**: Students should pursue topics they find interesting and engaging
- **Shit happens**: Create a safe space where mistakes are acceptable and
  students can openly discuss challenges

### Learning Approach

- **Self-directed learning**: Give students tools to learn independently
- **Big picture first**: Short presentations provide overview, then students
  explore deeper through hands-on materials
- **Flexible pace**: Students can choose their own path - theory first,
  practical first, or mixed
- **Hybrid-friendly**: All materials available for on-site or remote learning
- **Real-world relevance**: Focus on practical skills used in industry, not just
  academic exercises
- **"Teach them to fish"**: Guide students to find solutions rather than giving
  direct answers

### Pedagogical Foundations

- Bloom's taxonomy for learning objectives
- _"L'intelligence ce n'est pas ce que l'on sait mais ce que l'on fait quand on
  ne sait pas."_ - Jean Piaget
- Competency-based learning: mobilizing and combining resources to solve real
  problems

### Sustainability Integration (HES-SO Requirement)

The HES-SO requires all programs to integrate sustainability into their
curricula by 2030. This course follows the transversal approach recommended by
the HES-SO sustainability platform, where sustainability is woven into the
profession being taught rather than added as a separate module.

**Key principles:**

- Integrate sustainability 1-2 times across the course through projects
  connecting programming to ecological and social challenges
- Focus on how programming can contribute to ecological transition and social
  justice
- Develop systems thinking, critical reflection, and problem analysis skills
- Use examples like energy efficiency, digital sobriety, accessibility, open
  source, and local solutions
- Avoid moralizing; encourage critical thinking and informed choices

## General Guidelines

1. **Content Language**: Write all course materials in French
2. **Code Language**: Use Java for all code examples
3. **Pedagogical Level**: Adapt explanations to beginner level (first
   programming course)
4. **No Emojis**: Never use emojis in course materials, presentations, or
   exercises (except root README.md)
5. **Langage épicène**: Use gender-neutral language in French (e.g., "la
   personne qui étudie", "l'utilisatrice")
6. **Simple apostrophes**: Always use simple apostrophes (') instead of
   typographic apostrophes (')
7. **Real-world relevance**: Use practical examples with ecological and low-tech
   values
8. **English code**: All variable names, function names, class names, and
   identifiers in code must be in English following language conventions (Java,
   etc.)
